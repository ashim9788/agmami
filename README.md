This repository implements a federated learning framework in PyTorch with support for Byzantine (faulty or malicious) clients and multiple robust aggregation strategies. The system is intentionally designed for CPU-based parallel client training using `joblib`, ensuring correctness, reproducibility, and multiprocessing safety.
